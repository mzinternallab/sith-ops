Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Course

1. Deep Explanation of MLOps
MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, applies DevOps principles to the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning models. It bridges the gap between data science and production, ensuring that models are reproducible, scalable, and maintainable. Key stages include:

- Model Development: Data scientists explore and train models, using version control for code and data.

- Continuous Integration (CI: Automated testing, linting, and validation of model code, data pipelines, and configurations.

- Containerization: Packaging models and dependencies into Docker images for consistent deployments.

- Continuous Deployment (CD): Automated release of model images to Kubernetes clusters via GitLab CI/CD and GitOps tools like Argo CD.

- Monitoring and Observability: Tracking model performance, data drift, and infrastructure metrics in production.

- Governance and Compliance: Managing model lineage, access controls, and auditability.

By integrating these stages, MLOps accelerates model delivery, improves reliability, and enables collaboration between data science and engineering teams.



## 2. Example of an MLOps Workflow

An end-to-end MLOps workflow might look like this:

1. Code Commit: Data scientists push model code and pipeline definitions to GitLab.

2. CI Pipeline: GitLab CI runs unit tests, data validation checks, and builds a Docker image containing the model.

3. Artifact Registry: The built image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., GitLab Container Registry).

4. GitOps Deployment: Argo CD monitors a Git branch containing Kubernetes manifests for the model service.

5. Kubernetes Deployment: Argo CD syncs changes, deploying the new model version to the cluster.

6. Inference Service: A Kubernetes Service exposes the model via REST or gRPC for inference requests.

7. Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana collect metrics on request latency, error rates, and data drift.

8. Feedback Loop: Logged inference data and performance metrics feed back into retraining pipelines.


## 3. Step-by-Step Creation of an MLOps Tutorial Application

A. Sample ML Model to Deploy
We will use a simple Scikit-learn Iris classifier. The training script (`train.py`) resides in `model/`, producing a serialized model `iris_model.joblib`.

B. Deployment with Argo CD, GitLab CI, and Kubernetes
The pipeline and deployment consist of:

- GitLab CI/CD: Defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, it tests, builds, and pushes the Docker image to the GitLab Container Registry.


- Argo CD: Uses an `application.yaml` in `argo-cd/` to watch the `k8s/` manifests branch and deploy updates to the Kubernetes cluster.

- **Kubernetes**: Deployment and Service YAML files in `k8s/` directory define the model-serving service.
